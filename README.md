This is a small repository for the system files extracted from two recent finds -- very early versions of 
Seattle Computer Product's 86-DOS product used on its Gazelle system. Versions 0.10 and 0.34 were
recently found by Gene Buckle and uploaded to the Internet Archive.

The disks were imaged by Gene such that they can be used by SIMH's AltairZ80 emulator set to 8086. The
disks are relatively primative in comparison to MS-DOS, so extracting the system files required the
old-school use of DEBUG and console logging as the source files were not on the disk. These files
are set to "hidden" but there is no ATTRIB command to change them to visible, thus the need for
raw extraction.

This is a work-in-process and the files will change over time.
